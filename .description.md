The GHGA Transpiler is a Python library and command line utility to transpile the official GHGA metadata XLSX workbooks to JSON. Please note that the GHGA Transpiler does not validate that the provided metadata is compliant with the [GHGA Metadata Schema](https://github.com/ghga-de/ghga-metadata-schema). This can be achieved by running the [GHGA Validator](https://github.com/ghga-de/ghga-validator/) on the JSON data generated by the GHGA Transpiler.
